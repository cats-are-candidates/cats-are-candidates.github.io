This sad cat completed the ATC oral exam by June 2, 2020.  The sad cat was able to advance to Teaching Fellow status and was allowed to enroll in MATH 599 the following quarter.  The sad cat only realized that their ATC was never formally registered on November 4, 2021 when reviewing the Dissertation Year Fellowship (DYF) application requirements.  The sad cat contacted the math office and they said they would notify the Graduate Division.  Only after 4-5 more follow-ups and threatening to escalate to the graduate division did the math department process the ATC on January 16, 2022, only a few weeks before the DYF deadline.  This sad cat is very sad as they almost lost a huge fellowship opportunity due to delayed processing of their ATC.
