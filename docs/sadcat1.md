Sad cat completed the oral exam in March 2022, but did not have his ATC properly processed until April 2023.  Both sad cat and the cat's advisor notified the department that sad cat had passed their oral exam.  The department replied and said that they would prompt the docusign forms, however they in fact were never sent out.  The sad cat identified that their ATC was never processed in Winter 2023 when they tried to log-in to the portal to file their dissertation.  The math cat was preparing to graduate and in fact had received a postdoc offer from UCLA, indicating that the cat's performance was well above the candidate bar.  They reached out to the math department multiple times to ask about this issue, but did not receive a response.  The math cat had to go to the graduate division and get a case manager to investigate the issue.  After a herculean effort, more than 40 emails, and escalating to the department chair, the math cat's candidacy was finally processed in April 2023.  The math cat experienced extreme sadness and may never be the same.
