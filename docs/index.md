# About

I am a cat ensuring that UCLA math graduate students (a.k.a. math cats) get their advancement to candidacy (ATC) forms processed in a timely manner, so that they are happy cats not sad cats.  There have been multiple documented cases of UCLA math cats not getting their ATC forms processed by the UCLA admin despite having full support from their advisors and doctoral committee (one math cat received a written postdoc offer from UCLA before the cat's ATC form was processed!!!).  Since advancement to candidacy directly affects math cat wages, eligibility for fellowships, eligibility for reduced nonresident supplemental tuition (NRST), among other benefits, this is unexcusable and cannot be dismissed.  For this reason I am currently a sad cat, not a happy cat.  All cats go to heaven, but the ATC process is hell.  If you are a UCLA math cat, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfF650Zv96yZe7xd7Ra0LmUVMaHMJpS5usNS1Ddcdjouy_0YA/viewform?fbclid=IwAR3juzjfGwklUxOVuuDu58VdsV37Xaf47g72PhiMLTr2w1GRoye0EV6v66s) so that all UCLA math cats can have their ATC processed in a timely manner.  For further information about the implications and requirements of advancing to candidacy, please consult this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pzpZcQfoaEb1XplhtTKOnwOmkN7wkPg8JH3nmiXwOI0/edit?usp=sharing) written by a fellow math cat.  Click through the tabs at the top of this page to learn more about how UCLA math cats have become sad cats due to dysfunctional ATC processing.
