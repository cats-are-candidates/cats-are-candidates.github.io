This sad cat had email chains with the department about their forms not being processed in mid July, over a month and a half after the sad cat passed their ATC exam. The sad cat reached out to the math department admin because the cat saw that the ATC was not showing up on their transcript during the summer, and the cat knew that the forms regularly do not get processed. The cat has an email from a department administrator where they ask the cat "what's the urgency?'' about their ATC not being processed on July 19, 2022 almost two months after the cat did their ATC talk.  This sad cat was very stressed by the paperwork of their ATC not being filed.
